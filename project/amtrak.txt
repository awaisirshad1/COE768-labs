WASHINGTON — Jennifer Mitchell has been appointed as Amtrak’s executive vice president of strategy and planning, the company announced Tuesday (Nov. 26).

Amtrak says Mitchell will be responsible for setting the company’s long-term strategic vision and managing planning, infrastructure access, state partner, network development, and host railroad duties. Her transportation career most recently includes serving as deputy administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration; before that, she was director of the Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation. In Virginia, she played a key role in expanding the state’s rail program. She will join the company on Dec. 2, succeeding the retiring Dennis Newman.

“Jennifer has tremendous experience in the railroad industry and private sector that will be instrumental as we continue to grow and expand intercity passenger rail during this time of unprecedented demand,” Amtrak President Roger Harris said in a press release. “She’s the right person to lead our planning and strategy as we work to double our ridership by attracting more riders, serving new communities, and transforming passenger rail.”
